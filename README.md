# Galaxy-Hack-Database
A Database to keep track of all the Super Mario Galaxy mods released and/or WIP


# How to add your hack
To add your hack, Fork the repository and create a new file. The file should be named after your hack. For example, if you hack is named Super Mario Galaxy 3 then your filename would be `SMG3.md`. Use one of the Template files in this Repository as a base for your file. Use the WIP one for an unfinished hack. When you are done, make a Pull Request. If your hack is approved, it will be added to the main repository

# What counts as a "Hack"
We're talking levels here. So if it's a level, you're free to add it using the steps above.<br/>Level Collections (Such as Neo Mario Galaxy) are also allowed.
